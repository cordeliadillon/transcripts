## [0:00 - 7:18] Jerry-entology and other miscellaneous intro topics

_[intro music]_

**Patrick:** Welcome to [*Pop! Whiz! Bang!*](https://soundcloud.com/pwbpod/) a comic conversation with Meggie Ramm and Patrick Lay. I'm Patrick Lay. My pronouns are he/him.

**Meggie:** And I'm Meggie Ramm! My pronouns are she/her or they/them, and I don't know why I say my name like a radio announcer every time, but... This is not a podcast about the most recent releases from Marvel and DC; it's about the theory and process behind the comics that you know and love.

We have a _fuckin' awesome_ podcast today. We have a guest with us - it's Cordelia McGee-Tubb. Cordelia, say hi!

**Cordelia:** Hi everyone!

_[Meggie and Cordelia make excited sounds]_

**Meggie:** Am I saying your name right?

**Cordelia:** Yes!

**Meggie:** Okay, good. Cordelia's here to talk to us about accessibility in comics. Cordelia is a cartoonist as well as a bunch of other really awesome things. They've had multiple online comics, like [one two six oh four](http://onetwosixohfour.tumblr.com), a comic detailing their life at Vassar College, as well as [echo through the fog](http://echothroughthefog.cordeliadillon.com), which features autobiographical comics and illustrations. They're also a web accessibility engineer and most recently are working on accessibility at Salesforce and Dropbox.

In fact, you were just saying that you were at a women in tech conference this weekend?

**Cordelia:** Yep!

**Meggie:** That you had to drive 3 hours to get to, which sounds like way less fun.

**Cordelia:** Not driving, taking 3 different modes of transportation to get there! _[laughs]_

_[Patrick chuckles]_

**Meggie:** Oh, that's the worst.

**Cordelia:** Wooo!

_[laughter]_

**Meggie:** They've worked with senior citizens to help them improve their computer skills and done tech talks around the globe about accessibility and universal design. They already have a graduate degree in comics, which is where we met, but right now they're also working a full-time job while getting another graduate degree in -- gerontology? Gerontology?

**Cordelia:** Gerontology, like Jerry.

**Meggie:** Almost made it! Gerontology _[laughs]_ which is the study of Jerry's! Um, no, so it's the study of aging. And they're also really good at D&D, 'cause we play D&D together. So, hey Cordelia! Welcome to the podcast!

**Cordelia:** I'm super excited to be here! I also kind of want to study Jerry's.

**Meggie:** Just Jerry's.

**Cordelia:** Jerry... Seinfeld.

_[Meggie laughs]_

**Cordelia:** ...That's the only Jerry I can think of right now.

_[Patrick laughs]_

**Meggie:** Jerry from Parks & Rec, maybe?

**Cordelia:** Ooooooh!

**Patrick:** Gary, Jerry, Larry.

**Meggie:** But before we get into ze nitty-gritty, how is everybody doing right now? Patrick, how's Ohio.

**Patrick:** Ohio's good. It's been a long week! I worked so much this week. I worked all the days this week. So many weird little baby shifts, too. I think that definitely it is more exhausting for me to go into work on a day I don't normally work for 2 hours than to go in on a day I don't normally work for an entire shift. Because then at least I know what I'm doing, right? It's my whole day, but when you go in for just 2 hours, ugh! It just interrupts everything. ... But, we are here podcasting today! So it's already a good'un. It's a better'un.

**Meggie:** That's so funny that you've been working so much, because I've been working so little because the strike is still happening.

**Patrick:** I thought it was, uh - is it not over?

**Meggie:** Nooo, it's not. Well, maybe it happened. I haven't heard any news from over the weekend but I've had no classes. It's been really weird and I don't like it. I know that I can use this free time to work on other stuff, which I have been doing, but not teaching has been way harder for me than I thought it was going to be. And now every time I see a kid, I'm really enthusiastic, maybe to the point of being a little creepy.

_[laughter]_

**Meggie:** Whenever my students show up, I'm like, "OH MY GOD! I haven't seen you in forever!" and they're like, "Alright, tone it down, Meggie. It's been a week."

**Patrick:** You see a stranger in the grocery store, you're like, "LET ME TEACH YOU!! Let me -- I've got a chalkboard right here! Here's a _paaaanel_."

_[laughter]_

**Meggie:** I told you that one of my students that I had a year ago came into the comic book shop a while back and didn't recognize me. She came into the comic book shop with her dad, and I wanted to be like, "Hey! How's it going? How's school been?" But if she didn't remember me, that would be _insanely creepy_ to her father.

_[laughter]_

**Meggie:** This random person that he's definitely never met, just being like, "HEY! Remember me?!"

**Cordelia:** You were her teacher. That's not that weird.

**Meggie:** Yeah, but people don't recognize me. If I don't wear my glasses, or if I'm wearing a hat, or if I'm wearing lipstick, or if I'm not wearing earrings ... I had a guy come into the shop who I've seen come in every other week that I've worked there, and we've had interactions, and just this last Thursday, he was like, "Oh, uh, I'm sorry for not introducing myself. My name's Don." and I was like, "Yep. I'm Meggie. We've met before."

_[laughter]_

**Meggie:** "I'm sorry." And then he was like, "Oh my god, I'm so sorry." I'm like, "No, it's fine. My face just doesn't ever look the same." _[laughs]_ He was like, "Okay, now I'm even more intrigued." So... super fun!

_[laughter]_

**Cordelia:** You're a master of disguise. Just put on earrings and now you're --

**Meggie:** I mean, honestly, I put on a hat and earrings and apparently that's just like my glasses, a la Clark Kent. Nobody will know who I am. That's when I'm gonna commit all the crimes.

Cordelia, how's your week been? Have people been recognizing you?

**Cordelia:** People _have_ been recognizing me. It's been a bit of a stressful week. I had a midterm exam for my study of Jerry's, I went and spoke on a panel about being a woman in tech, and now I'm speaking on this podcast, so I'm basically just doing all these different disparate things that all sort of overlap in my head. So, I dunno.

**Meggie:** It's good, at least you're doing talks about stuff that you really enjoy, as opposed to talks about, I dunno, Trump.

**Cordelia:** Yeah.

_[laughter]_

**Meggie:** That's the only person that came into my head.

_[Patrick laughs, Cordelia groans]_

**Meggie:** At the comic shop we have a lot of MAD magazines about Trump kind of up at the front, and I had this one kid just come up and look at the Trump magazine and just be like, "He's not _cute_" and just walk away. _[laughs]_ They were like 3, and that was the only thing they said. Ah, I love kids who visit the comic shop, it's so great. Alright-

**Cordelia:** Of all the things you could say about him _[laughter]_ - "He's not cute" - there are a lot of other things I would also say about his character.

**Meggie:** Yeah, but they were like 3. Their insult capacity hasn't really evolved to the point where they can be creative with it.

**Patrick:** Yeah, at the 3-year-old level, that was probably about the right amount of sophistication.

**Meggie:** That was a _sick burn_. _[laughter]_ That was the sickest burn that kid's ever gonna give. _[laughter]_

## [7:18 - 12:24] Why are we talking about accessible comics today?

**Meggie:** So, today we're talking about accessibility in comics, which is something that Patrick and I know very little about but that Cordelia knows quite a lot about, because you've given a couple talks about this. And we're actually going to put [your slideshow](https://www.slideshare.net/cordeliadillon/accessible-comics-id24) onto our Twitter and our Instagram - not the whole thing, but a link - for people to check out. So, that's really cool!

Cordelia, tell us about accessibility in comics! I'm so _fucking_ excited, you don't understand!

**Cordelia:** Well, maybe I'll just start with a little bit of background on why I've been thinking a lot about this. I spend my days working on web accessibility, on making websites that work well for people across this wide range of abilities. A lot of what I do at work is think about if someone is blind, how are they accessing these websites we're building? A lot of that is about making sure things are screen reader accessible; a screen reader is this form of assistive technology that literally reads the screen to you, either in braille or audio output. So I was doing all this as my full-time job and on the side making comics, and realizing, hey, comics is a really visual medium and that is kind of in contrast to the work that I do every day. How can I start to think about those two overlapping with each other?

So then I started doing research on comics accessibility. I'm not an expert, but I just like chatting with people about it.

**Meggie:** I feel like it's a very niche thing, so I feel like you probably are the closest thing to an expert that we're gonna get on this podcast. _[Cordelia laughs]_ Have you always been interested in accessibility? You went to Vassar for tech, right, specifically?

**Cordelia:** So, it's a liberal arts college, I studied Computer Science there. The Computer Science department was, like, 5 people literally in the basement of a building called the Old Laundry Building.

_[laughter]_

**Patrick:** [snorting with laughter] Ah, I'm sorry, that's the perfect liberal arts college experience.

**Cordelia:** It was a great experience!

**Patrick:** Right, right. You would get a good education at the Old Laundry Building, but _damn_!

_[laughter]_

**Meggie:** Great education, still smelled like fabric softener, but great education.

**Patrick:** Honestly, it was probably the best-smelling building in the joint, if it smelled like laundry. Unless it smelled like _old_ laundry...

**Cordelia:** My favorite smell of all-time is the smell of the exhaust from dryers.

**Patrick:** YES. Oh my god, it's the greatest! It's the greatest.

**Meggie:** Especially when you're walking down the street and you just smell it coming out of a building, I'm always into that. Is that weird?

**Cordelia:** No, that's why I picked it.

**Meggie:** Okay, good.

**Patrick:** It's the only joy at the laundromat to be had. I do my laundry at the laundromat and it sucks, but it does smell hardcore like dryer laundry, and it's just like, "Mmmm... I want to put on all these clothes _now_." Is that weird? Everything's so dry and warm!

**Meggie:** There's this stand-up comedian I can't remember, but she has something on Netflix, and she's like, "If you ever want to feel truly loved, just take a huge amount of clothes straight out of the dryer and lie in it." _[laughter]_ Just make yourselve a little cave.

**Cordelia:** Can confirm.

**Patrick:* So at the Old Laundry Building...

**Cordelia:** Oh!

_[laughter as we try to get back on track]_ 

**Meggie:** Patrick's gonna get so stuck on this Old Laundry Building.

**Patrick:** No, no, no, no, I'm on board. So, at the Old Laundry Building, doing Computer Science ... We'll get back on track. What were you doing?

**Cordelia:** Oh, right. I studied Computer Science there, but because it was a liberal arts college, I was also studying Anthropology and, uh, I was gonna say Sociology but _[voice trailing off]_ I didn't study Sociology.

_[laughter]_

**Patrick:** Some people did.

**Cordelia:** ... Just a lot of liberal arts things. Some people did. That was an option. And, I think when I first started out in the tech world, I was like, "Woah! Everyone else here has this intense Computer Science degree from an engineering school." It took me a while to realize that, actually, studying Computer Science at a liberal arts school was one of the best things that could have happened to me, because I thought a lot about Computer Science and technology in terms of how _people_ use it. There are a variety of people in the world. Everyone's different, so everyone uses technology different, so it needs to kind of adapt to everyone's unique situations.

**Meggie:** Yeah, if you're young and want to be employed, soon, or you're trying to pick a major, you should do that. Get a Computer Science major from a liberal arts college. Because, if you get a graduate degree from a comic book college, you're gonna be unemployed as shit, lemme tell you! _[laughter]_ ... Keep going!

**Cordelia:** Don't cry, Meggie. 

_[laughter]_ 

## [12:24 - ?]

**Cordelia:** Anyway, so that's been my passion in tech, but then I've also been making comics forever. So I was like, "How do we combine all of these, and what does it look like to make comics that are accessible to people with vision impairments?" And that can be everything from someone who's low vision to someone who's completely blind, to even if you think about color-blindness - I think it's 1 in 10 men is colorblind? How are we using colors in our stories? What impact does that have on someone who may perceive a wide variety of colors as a murky shade of brown? So that's kinda what I've been thinking about.

**Meggie:** That's awesome.
